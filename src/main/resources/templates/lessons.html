  <h1>Language Lessons</h1>

  <p>
    At DFC Hangul, we believe that everyone learns best when supported at the right level.  
    Our club offers lessons taught by <strong>native Korean speakers</strong> with a wide range of experience.  
    Students are matched with teachers according to their skill level â€” whether youâ€™re a complete beginner, 
    brushing up on basics, or practicing conversational fluency.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>When &amp; Where:</strong>  
    Lessons are held every <strong>Friday</strong> in <em>FN 2.210</em>, scheduled between <strong>12:30 â€“ 3:00 PM</strong>.  
    Each student will be paired with an appropriate teacher during that block of time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lessons cover both <em>language</em> and <em>culture</em> â€” from grammar and vocabulary to everyday expressions, 
    nuances of polite speech, and insights into Korean customs. Many students also find motivation in connecting 
    lessons to <strong>K-Dramas, K-Pop lyrics, and cultural activities</strong>, making learning both fun and practical.
