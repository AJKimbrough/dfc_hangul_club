  <h1>About DFC Hangul</h1>

  <!-- Welcome message -->
  <p>
    We are a club on campus that promotes learning, understanding, and respecting Korean language and culture. 
    Our weekly lessons are led by native Korean speakers who have lived in Korea and can not only teach you 
    a beautiful language complete with the nuances and quirks of native speaking, but also share the richness 
    of Korean culture.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a wide range of levels and dialects represented, our teachers bring their joy and love for their country 
    into each lesson. Whether you’re curious about <strong>K-Dramas</strong>, <strong>K-Pop</strong>, or simply want 
    to broaden your global perspective, DFC Hangul is a welcoming place to learn, connect, and have fun.
  </p>

    <a th:href="@{/lessons}" class="highlight-link">Lessons</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Our <strong>weekly lessons</strong> meet every Friday in <em>ECSS 2.203</em>. Students are matched with teachers
    at the right level—whether you’re brand new to Korean, brushing up on basics, or practicing conversation.
    Lessons weave together language and culture (expressions, polite speech, customs), and many members connect what
    they learn to <em>K-Dramas</em>, <em>K-Pop</em>, and everyday Korean life.
    For details as they’re updated, visit the <a class="highlight-link" th:href="@{/lessons}">Lessons page</a>.

  <!-- Club Meetings -->

  <p>
    We also hold <strong>biweekly meetings</strong> that celebrate Korean culture through food, games, crafts, and
    community activities. These gatherings give everyone a chance to enjoy traditions, share meals, play games, and
    build friendships outside the classroom. Curious what that looks like? Check out our
    <a class="highlight-link" th:href="@{/club}">Club page</a> to see how we bring the community together, or hop over to the 
     <a class="highlight-link" th:href="@{/events}">Events page</a> to see what’s coming up next.
