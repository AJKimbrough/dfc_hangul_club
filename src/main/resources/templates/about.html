  <h1>About DFC Hangul</h1>

  <!-- Welcome message -->
  <p>
    We are a club on campus that promotes learning, understanding, and respecting Korean language and culture. 
    Our weekly lessons are led by native Korean speakers who have lived in Korea and can not only teach you 
    a beautiful language complete with the nuances and quirks of native speaking, but also share the richness 
    of Korean culture.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a wide range of levels and dialects represented, our teachers bring their joy and love for their country 
    into each lesson. Whether you’re curious about <strong>K-Dramas</strong>, <strong>K-Pop</strong>, or simply want 
    to broaden your global perspective, DFC Hangul is a welcoming place to learn, connect, and have fun.
