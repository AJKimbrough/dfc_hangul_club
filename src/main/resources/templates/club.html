  <h1>DFC Hangul — Club Activities</h1>

  <p>
    Beyond weekly lessons, DFC Hangul hosts <strong>biweekly meetings on Thursdays from 2:30 – 4:00 PM</strong> 
    where members come together to celebrate Korean culture, build friendships, and just have fun.  
    These meetings are relaxed, community-focused, and full of creative ideas — from holidays to games to food and more.

  <h2>💡🎉 Club Spark Ideas — 재미있는 아이디어 </h2>
  <ul class="club-ideas">
    <li><strong>Holiday Celebrations:</strong>  
      Host special days like <em>Chuseok</em> (Korean harvest festival) — we could rent out hanbok (traditional dresses) or simply gather to learn and celebrate together.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Games:</strong>  
      Play Korean traditional games, fun Korean-inspired games, or even English word games with a Korean twist (think <em>Heads Up</em> with vocab practice).  
      <em>Bonus idea:</em> A Korean-word <strong>Bingo Day</strong> fundraiser with prizes!
    </li>
    <li><strong>Shows & Media:</strong>  
      Watch and discuss Korean dramas, variety shows, or even dive into manhwa (Korean comics) for cultural exposure.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Food Adventures:</strong>  
      Cook simple Korean dishes together (like <em>tteokbokki</em> or kimbap), or plan outings to nearby Korean restaurants for a taste of authentic cuisine.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Arts & Crafts:</strong>  
      Try Korean cultural crafts — origami-style folding, traditional art projects, or creative DIYs.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Vocab Day:</strong>  
      Label the entire room with sticky notes (door, table, whiteboard, etc.) and practice words and sentences together in a fun way.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Sharing Circles:</strong>  
      Casual sit-downs where members share their Korean learning journey, ask questions, and encourage each other.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Ice Breakers:</strong>  
      Fun activities to help members connect — like Korean-themed bingo, name games, and language-infused challenges.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These ideas are always growing and evolving — the goal is to make each meeting 
    both fun <em>and</em> meaningful, giving members a chance to practice Korean, 
    experience cultural traditions, and build lasting friendships.  
    Everyone’s welcome to contribute their own ideas!
